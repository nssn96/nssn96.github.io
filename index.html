          <p>We operate the garage door using a passcode. The username and password are entered, it is compared with the authentic one in the code, and if the input is correct, the garage door automatically opens. If any input data is wrong, the access is denied. I learned from this application that there is extensive integration between computer programming and electronics, where we can use the LABVIEW software for many applications such as automating any process, proof of concept before building the electronic circuits, developing R&D service and testing tools for hardware products.

          <p>Software : MATLAB</p>
          <p>Data validation and reconciliation (DVR) plays key role in industries because it uses process information and statistical methods to estimate correct measurements from the observed data. DR is very effective when measurement is free from gross error. Data observed from chemical processes can be serially correlated. Serial correlation in data can arise when a process, takes time to adjust, is exposed to prolonged influences, when data is manipulated or smoothened. If serial correlation is not taken care of, then gross error detection may be inaccurate. Hence dealing serial correlation is important in gross error detection (GED) techniques. Most of the techniques implemented in gross error detection require no correlation in the measurement. But experimental data may have serial correlation. In this project, various approaches like variance correction and pre-whitening are implemented to deal serial correlation on ARMA process and measurement test (MT) is applied to detect gross error. Results portray that MT is not an efficient method for GED and amongst the above mentioned two methods, pre-whitening with low variance is better than variance correction method.</p>

            <p>In this blog, I hope to show how I worked through the famous Titanic problem in kaggle for Beginners. 
              The goal is to correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck.</p>
            <p> In this project we need to create a machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
               In this challenge, I built a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). 
              </p>
              <p> Lets see the each steps that I used to approach the problem where I improved my score of  
                <b>0.76555</b> to <b>0.77511</b>. I am adding my <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nssurya1996/titanic-problem"> kaggle Notebook </a>that I used for the Project for reference</p> </br>
                <div class="subheading mb-3">DATASET </div>
                <p>There are two files that we would be given under the data tab on the top of the competition page. 
                  The two files that we use are the : (1) train.csv (2) test.csv</p>
                  <p><b>train.csv</b> contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers, where each passenger gets a different row in the table).
                    The values in the second column "Survived" can be used to determine whether each passenger survived or not. If it is '1' - the passenger survived, if '0' the passenger died.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>test.csv</b>-- Using the patterns we find in train.csv, we have to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (in test.csv) survived.</p>
                  <p>Our prediction submission file must contain only two columns, if we have more than that we will face issue while submission.The file must contain a "PassengerId" column containing the IDs 
                    of each passenger from test.csv.A "Survived" column (that we will create!) with a "1" for the rows where we think the passenger survived, and a "0" where we predict that the passenger died.</p>

                    <p>From the above table we can see that there are lot of null values in Age and Cabin Column and two null values in Embarked Column out of total 891 entries</p>

                    <p>To better understand the numerical data , we can use the .describe() method.This gives us an understanding of the central
                      tendencies of the data</p>

                    <p>From the above histogram we can know that the Age is a normal distribution whereas the other features are not normally distributed. So, we might need to normalise the features like Fare, to have its correct contribution during the Prediction</p>

                    <p>From the above heatmap we can infer some correlations between features. for eg: 1) The number of parents and number of sibilings ie family tend to travel together.2)The Age and the number of siblings(SibSp) has a negative correlation and such. These help us to understand the different relationship in our data.</p>

                    <p>Even though it might not contribute directly, we might get a understanding of the data like younger people have survived more and the people who paid high fare had high chances of survival. These are the things we need to make note of while building our models.</p>

                    <p>From the above pivot table we can understand that relatively the lot of people from first class survived,lot of women compared to men were rescued first.We can understand that this feature(sex) will play an important contribution in the prediction.</p>

                    <p>I have used what's known as a random forest model. This model is constructed of several "trees" that will individually consider each passenger's data and vote on whether the individual survived. Then, the random forest model makes a decision based on majority: the outcome with the most votes wins.The code cell below looks for patterns in four different columns ("Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", and "Parch") of the data. It constructs the trees in the random forest model based on patterns in the train.csv file, before generating predictions for the passengers in test.csv.</p>
                    <p>Creating the RandomeForestClassifer model to train and fit the data. After that we predict whether the passengers in the test_data had survived or not(0/1). At the end we load the predictions to prediction_submission.csv.</p>
